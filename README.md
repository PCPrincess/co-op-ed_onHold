# IdeallySpeaking0.4
Down the Rabbit Hole With .NET Core and VS2017

The Motivation: Advance My Skills and Knowledge in Web Development
Organization and Planning: Slack and Github Projects

**Step 1:** Go in-depth with HTML and CSS and gain the ability to design and code awesome UI(s)
I used [Mozilla's MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
 
**Step 2:** Learn C# Syntax and Usage

**Step 3:** Learn .NET Core and [ASP.Net](https://github.com/aspnet/home) MVC

**Step 4:** Build, Code, Learn, and Amaze Myself

**Current Projects**  
[IdeallySpeaking- Private Repo](https://github.com/PCPrincess/IdeallySpeaking0.4)  
[RepresentApp](https://github.com/PCPrincess/RepresentativeApp)

[IdeallySpeaking.net](http://ideallyspeaking.net) is viewable in its development state.
Bear in mind that, during local development, pages that require a non-null entry in the database will return a 404.
